 * \brief Validates an input field with libpwquality to check password quality.
 *
 * This validator uses <a href="https://github.com/libpwquality/libpwquality">libpwquality</a> to generate a
 * password quality score that is compared against a \a threshold. If it is below the \a threshold, the validation
 * fails. According to libpwquality a score of 0-30 is of low, a score of 30-60 of medium and a score of 60-100
 * of high quality. Everything below 0 is an error and the password should not be used.
 *
 * <h3>Building</h3>
 * As this validator relies on an external library, it will not be included and build by default. Use either
 * <code>-DPLUGIN_VALIDATOR_PWQUALITY:BOOL=ON</code> or <code>-DBUILD_ALL:BOOL=ON</code> when configuring %Cutelyst
 * for build with cmake. In your %Cutelyst application you can check if \c CUTELYST_VALIDATOR_WITH_PWQUALITY has been
 * defined to see if this validator is available.
 *
 * <h3>Options</h3>
 * %ValidatorPwQuality can take additional \a options. To learn more about the available options see <code>man 5 pwquality.conf</code>.
 * The options value can be either a QVariantMap containing the options or a QString specifying a file name that will be read
 * by libpwquality. For the constructor the options will also be searched in the current \link Context::stash() stash\endlink if
 * it is a QString. The stash value should than be either a QVariantMap or a QString pointing to a configuration file. All values
 * in the QVariantMap used to specify \a options, have to be convertible into QString. The QVariantMap does not have to contain
 * all available option keys, for keys that are not contained, the default values of libpwquality will be used. If the \a options
 * QVariant is not valid or if a contained QString or QVariantMap is empty, the options from the default libpwquality configuration
 * file will be read.
 *
 * \note Unless \link Validator::validate() validation\endlink is started with \link Validator::NoTrimming NoTrimming\endlink,
 * whitespaces will be removed from the beginning and the end of the input value before validation.
 * If the \a field's value is empty or if the \a field is missing in the input data, the validation will succeed without
 * performing the validation itself. Use one of the \link ValidatorRequired required validators \endlink to require the
 * field to be present and not empty.
 *
 * \sa Validator for general usage of validators.

 * \since Cutelyst 2.0.0
