A Web Framework built on top of Qt, using the simple and elegant approach of Catalyst (Perl) framework.

Qt's meta object system is what powers the core of Cutelyst, it allows for introspecting controller's methods signatures and generate matching actions that can be invoked later. Main features:

 * Cross-platform
 * Pluggable Engines
   * uWSGI - Multiple protocols support (HTTP 1.0, FastCGI, uWSGI)
   * Cutelyst-WSGI - A cross-platform and fast WSGI engine (HTTP 1.1 and FastCGI both with Pipelining and Keep-Alive support)
 * WebSockets
 * REST with ActionREST
 * Plugin based views
   * [Grantlee](http://www.grantlee.org) (A Qt implementation of Django's template engine)
   * [Clearsilver](http://www.clearsilver.net)
   * JSON
   * [Email](https://github.com/cutelyst/simple-mail)
