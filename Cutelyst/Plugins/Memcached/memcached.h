/**
 * @brief %Cutelyst %Memcached plugin.
 *
 * The %Memcached plugin for %Cutelyst can be used to store, retrieve, delete and modify data on a
 * <A HREF="https://www.memcached.org/">memcached</A> general-purpose distributed memory caching system.
 * It uses <A HREF="http://docs.libmemcached.org">libmemcached</A> to connect to a pool of memcached servers
 * and to perform the caching operations. In order to build this plugin, the libmemcached development and header
 * files have to be present at build time.
 *
 * Basically all values are stored as QByteArray. So, to store simple types, simply convert them into a QByteArray
 * and vice versa on retrieval. For more complex or custom types you can use QDataStream to serialize them into
 * a QByteArray. For most methods in this plugin there are template functions for convenience that perform this
 * serialization. The requirement to use them is that the types to store and get provide stream operators for
 * QDataStream.
 *
 * <H3>Configuration</h3>

 * The %Memcached plugin can be configured in the cutelyst configuration file in the @c Cutelyst_Memcached_Plugin section.
 * It uses the same configuration strings as <A HREF="http://docs.libmemcached.org/libmemcached_configuration.html">libmemcached</A>
 * but in lowercase and without the dashes in front and for consistence @a - replaced by @a _ . So @c --BINARY-PROTOCOL will be
 * @c binary_protocol. To add servers and/or sockets use the @a servers configuration key. Servers can be added with name, port and
 * weight, separated by @c , - multiple servers are separated by a @c ; . To add sockets, use a full path as name. If no configuration
 * has been set or if the @a servers configuration key is empty, a default server at localhost on port 11211 will be used.
 *
 * Additional to the <A HREF="http://docs.libmemcached.org/libmemcached_configuration.html">configuration options of libmemcached</A> there are some plugin specific options:
 * @li @a compression - boolean value, enables compression of input values based on qCompress / zlib (default: disabled)
 * @li @a compression_level - integer value, the compression level used by qCompress (default: -1)
 * @li @a compression_threshold - integer value, the compression size threshold in bytes, only input values bigger than the threshold will be compressed (default: 100)
 * @li @a encryption_key - string value, if set and not empty, AES encryption will be enabled (default: empty)
 * @li @a sasl_user - string value, if set and not empty, SASL authentication will be used - note that SASL support has to be enabled when building libmemcached (default: empty)
 * @li @a sasl_password - string value, if set and not empty, SASL authentication will be used (default: empty)
 *
 * @note If you want to use non-ASCII key names you have to enable the binary protocol.
 *
 * To set default values directly in your application, use setDefaultConfig(). Configuration values that can not be found
 * in the Cutelyst configuration file will be looked up for default values in that QVariantMap.
 *
 * <H4>Configuration example</h4>
 *
 * @code{.ini}
 * [Cutelyst_Memcached_Plugin]
 * servers=cache.example.com,11211,2;/path/to/memcached.sock,1
 * binary_protocol=true
 * namespace=foobar
 * @endcode
 *
 * <H3>Expiration times</H3>
 *
 * Expiration times are set in seconds. If the value is bigger than 30 days, it is interpreted as a unix timestamp.
 *
 * <H3>Logging and return types</H3>
 * Messages from this plugin are logged to the logging category @a cutelyst.plugin.memcached. All methods provide
 * the possibility to specify a pointer to a MemcachedReturnType variable that can provide further information
 * about occured errors if methods return @c false or empty results.
 *
 * <H3>Usage example</H3>
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include <Cutelyst/Plugins/Memcached/Memcached>
 *
 * bool MyCutelystApp::init()
 * {
 *     // other initialization stuff
 *     // ...
 *
 *     new Memcached(this);
 *
 *     // maybe more initialization stuff
 *     //...
 * }
 *
 * void MyController::index(Context *c)
 * {
 *     QVariantList myData = Memcached::get<QVariantList>(QStringLiteral("myKey"));
 *     if (myData.empty()) {
 *         QSqlQuery q = CPreparedSqlQuery(QStringLiteral("SELECT * FROM myTable"));
 *         if (q.exec()) {
 *             myData = Sql::queryToHashList(q);
 *             if (!myData.empty()) {
 *                 Memcached::set(QStringLiteral("myKey"), myData, 900);
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     // present your data
 *     // ...
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * <H3>Build requirements</H3>
 *
 * To build this plugin you need the development and header files for <A HREF="http://libmemcached.org">libmemcached</A>
 * and run cmake with <CODE>-DPLUGIN_MEMCACHED:BOOL=ON</CODE>.
 *
 * <H4>Unit test</H4>
 *
 * Enabling the build of the %Memcached plugin will also enable the unit tests for this plugin. To perform the unit tests,
 * there has to be at least one memcached server running. By default, the test uses a memcached server on localhost and
 * default port 11211. To improve testing and/or to use other and/or multiple servers, you can set the @c CUTELYST_MEMCACHED_TEST_SERVERS
 * environment variable in your build environment to define different servers. The syntax is the same as for adding servers
 * in the configuration file. If you have for examble two servers, one on default location and another one on a unix socket,
 * use the following for in bash:
 *
 * @code{.sh}
 * export CUTELYST_MEMCACHED_TEST_SERVERS=localhost;/tmp/memcached.sock
 * @endcode
 *
 * @since Cutelyst 1.11.0
