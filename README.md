# Cutelyst - The Qt Web Framework <img title="Cutelyst" src="http://i.imgur.com/us1pKAP.png" width="60px" alt="Cutelyst logo"/>

A Web Framework built on top of Qt, using the simple and elegant approach of Catalyst (Perl) framework.

Qt's meta object system is what powers the core of Cutelyst, it allows for introspecting controller's methods signatures and generate matching actions that can be invoked later.
