 * \class ValidatorEmail validatoremail.h <Cutelyst/Plugins/Utils/validatoremail.h>
 * \brief Checks if the value is a valid email address according to specific RFCs.
 *
 * You can use a \link ValidatorEmail::Category Category\endlink as threshold to define which level of compliance you accpet as valid.
 * The default threshold RFC5321 for example will only allow email addresses that can be sent without modification through SMTP. If
 * the address would contain comments like <code>(main address)test\@example.com</code>, it would not be valid because the \link ValidatorEmail::CFWSComment
 * CFWSComment\endlink diagnose is above the threshold. If it would contain a quoted string like <code>"main test address"\@example.com</code> it would be
 * valid because the \link ValidatorEmail::RFC531QuotedString RFC5321QuotedString\endlink diagnose is under the threshold.
 *
 * The parser used to validate the email address is a reimplementation of Dominic Sayersâ€™ <a href="https://github.com/dominicsayers/isemail">isemail</a> PHP parser.
 *
 * \note Unless \link Validator::validate() validation\endlink is started with \link Validator::NoTrimming NoTrimming\endlink,
 * whitespaces will be removed from the beginning and the end of the input value before validation.
 * If the \a field's value is empty or if the \a field is missing in the input data, the validation will succeed without
 * performing the validation itself. Use one of the \link ValidatorRequired required validators \endlink to require the
 * field to be present and not empty.
 *
 * \sa Validator for general usage of validators.
