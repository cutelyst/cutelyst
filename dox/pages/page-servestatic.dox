\page servestatic Serve static files
\tableofcontents
There are different ways to serve static files like JavaScript and CSS. The easiest way is
to simply register StaticSimple or StaticCompressed plugin in your reimplementation of
Application::init(). Other ways are to use the static maps of %Cutelyst Server or to use a
web server like Apache in front of your Cutelyst %Server that also serves your static files
directly without using %Cutelyst.

\section servestatic-plugins Use a plugin to serve static files
Using a plugin like StaticSimple or StaticCompressed is the most easiest to implement way
of serving static files with %Cutelyst. Simply register one of the pulgins in your appâ€™s init
function and set include paths to the directories containing your static files:

\code{.cpp}
using namespace Cutelyst;

bool MyCutelystApp::init()
{

    // other initialization stuff
    // ...

    // construct a new StaticSimple plugin that will automatically be registered
    auto stat = new StaticSimpe(this);
    stat->setIncludePaths({"/path/to/my/include/files"});

    // maybe more initialization stuff
    // ..
}
\endcode

StaticCompressed is similar to use. Both plugins either serve files beginning with a specific
configurable path or try to identify static files as paths ending with something that looks
like a file extension like <tt>/assets/css/style.css</tt>. From the example above, the plugin
would try to find <tt>style.css</tt> at <tt>/path/to/my/include/files/assets/css/style.css</tt>
when your request path is <tt>/assets/css/style.css</tt>.

See the documentation of StaticSimple and StaticCompressed to learn more about these plugins.

\section servestatic-cutelystserver Use the Cutelyst server to serve static files
The %Cutelyst Server, that is started by \c \serverexec or manually by your own application, can
also directly serve static files. Using \c \serverexec you have the options <tt>\-\-static-map</tt>
and <tt>\-\-static-map2</tt> that can be used multiple times to add mappings for static file
directories. While <tt>static-map</tt> removes the mount point from the request path,
<tt>static-map2</tt> appends the complete request path.

\subsection servestatic-cutelystserver-staticmap static-map
The \c static-map option takes values of the form <tt>/mount/point=/path/to/static/files</tt>.
When searching for the requested file in your local directory, it will remove the mountpoint
part from the request path and will than append the rest of the request path to your local
path and will try to find the file.

If you set the following <tt>static-map</tt> for example:
<tt>\-\-static-map /assets=/path/to/static/assets</tt>. If you than request a file like
<tt>http://localhost:3000/assets/js/script.js</tt>, %Cutelyst %Server will try the static map
for mountpoint \a /assets, that is available. It will than remove the mountpoint from the request
path \a /assets/js/script.js and will append the rest to the local path. It will than try to find
the requested file at <tt>/path/to/static/assets/js/scripts.js</tt>.

\subsection servestatic-cutelystserver-staticmap2 static-map2
The \c static-map2 option takes values of the form <tt>/mount/point=/path/to/static/files</tt>.
When searching for the requested file in your local directory, it will completely append the
request path including the mount point to the local path and will try to find the file.

If you set the following<tt>static-map2</tt> for example:
<tt>\-\-static-map2 /assets=/path/to/static</tt>. If you than request a file like
<tt>http://localhost:3000/assets/js/script.js</tt>, %Cutelyst %Server will try the static map
for mountpoint \a /assets, that is available. It will than append the complete request path to
the local path will try to find the requested file at <tt>/path/to/static/assets/js/script.js</tt>.
