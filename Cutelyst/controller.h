 * @brief %Cutelyst %Controller base class
 *
 * Controllers are where the actions in the Cutelyst framework reside.
 * Each action is represented by a function with an attribute to identify
 * what kind of action it is. See the Cutelyst::Dispatcher for more info
 * about how Cutelyst dispatches to actions.
 *
 * Use C_ATTR to give hints about methods
 * build like methodName_option
 * Where option is one of the following:
 *
 * \b :Path - An ending path relative to the class info Namespace
 * for example:
 * \n :Path("") - /namespace/controlername (used for the index)
 * \n :Path("foo") - /namespace/controlername/foo
 * \n :Path("/bar") - /namespace/bar
 *
 * \b :Chained - Sets the name of this part of the chain. If it
 * is specified without arguments, it takes the name of
 * the action as default.
 *
 * \b :PathPart - The part of the chained path
 *
 * \b :Args - In the case of more than 9 parameters, to build
 * the path set the needed number here, where an empty string
 * means unlimited arguments.
 *
 * \b :CaptureArgs - In the case of more than 9 parameters, to
 * be captured the path set the needed number here, where -1
 * means unlimited arguments.
 *
 * \b :Global - Alias to Path="/methodname" which sets the
 * method relative to your root.
 *
 * \b :Local - Alias to Path="methodname".
 *
 * \b :Args - When used with "Path" it indicates the number of
 * arguments in the path.
 * \n The number is computed by counting the arguments the method expects.
 * \n However if no Args value is set, assumed to 'slurp' all
 *    remaining path parts under this namespace.
 *
 * There are also three special methods that can be implemented
 * that will be automatically dispatched, they are Begin(),
 * Auto() and End().
 *
 * Begin(Context*) and End(Context*) are both called on the closest
 * namespace match. If the Controller implements Begin it's that action
 * that will be called otherwise it will try to match looking at the
 * namespace.
 *
 * Auto(Context*) is called in namespace order, so if
 * you have a Foo and a FooBar controller with 'foo' and 'foo/bar'
 * namespaces respectively and both implement Auto(), you get
 * Foo->Auto() and FooBar->Auto() called.
